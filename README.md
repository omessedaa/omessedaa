Automation builder. Homelab tinkerer. Systems & workflows. Montréal, QC.

I like turning repetitive work into **clean scripts**, **reusable templates**, and **documented setups**.

## 🔧 What I work with
- Python • Linux • Docker • Proxmox • Networking • Automation
- Observability & self-hosting (monitoring, reverse proxies, auth, backups)

## ⭐ Featured project
### Centris Photo Downloader (Colab)
A Google Colab + Playwright notebook that captures listing images, removes duplicates, keeps only the best versions, and exports a clean ZIP.

## 🧭 Current direction
- Homelab documentation & deployment templates  
- Automation utilities (data extraction, cleanup, reporting)  
- Small tools that improve day-to-day workflows
